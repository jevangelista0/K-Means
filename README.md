# K-Means
K-means Clustering assigns a label to each point and helps the program know how to group the labels using a series of calculations.

Kmeans_image_data1.txt -> image in binary
Kmeans_image_data2.txt -> image in binary
out1.txt -> each entry is a point in the 2 dimentional matrix
out2.txt -> the step by step iteration of grouping the labels
out3.txt -> each entry after the header (first two lines) are the x coordinate, y coordinate and the label
